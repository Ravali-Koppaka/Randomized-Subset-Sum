# Randomized-Subset-Sum
An improved solution to existing randomized approximation approach to subset sum problem.

Existing randomized approach - http://web.stevens.edu/algebraic/Files/SubsetSum/przydatek99fast.pdf .

Existing Randomized approach has a runtime O(n*log(n)).
My improvement to the problem gives a linear runtime O(n) some trade off with approximation error.
As a future work, some improvement can be done for reducing the approximation error.
